# Shield
SHIELD is a project about terminating the question paper piracy in INDIA.
## Problem
Question paper piracy is a critical issue in INDIA due to which people with power get to secure seats while those who deserve it are left helpless. There are many ways that question papers have been pirated over the years but most of the time, culprits cut the packet of the question paper, take a snap of it, and share it over the internet.
## How SHIELD would solve it:

We will send question papers to the institutions in a box. Using the " Shield " App, the box can be locked from the inside over the internet. If someone breaks the box without any authorization of the Ministry of Education it will send an immediate email and notification to the nearest police station and the Ministry of Education.

## App Features

- In the app dashboard there are eight different card views consisting of the name of the Board under the Ministry of Education.
- Say we want to LOCK all the boxes under Delhi Board then we can head over to the Dhaka Board CardView.
- Here we can see the LOCK and UNLOCK buttons.
- Underneath that we can see the basic information of the Delhi Board.
- If the Authority presses the LOCK button all the boxes under the Delhi board will be LOCKED from inside over the internet.
- If some culprits break the box without any authorization of the Ministry of Education the App will send an immediate email and notification to the nearest Police station and the Ministry of Education.
- By simply pressing the 'locate' button, we can instantly access the real-time location of the box. 

## Built With
- For The Android App I have used __JAVA__
- To program NodeMCU (Single-board microcontroller) I have used __C++__
- After analyzing all the sensor data for triggering automated puch notification I have used __Python__
- For the realtime database management I have used __Firebase__
